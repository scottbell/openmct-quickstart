# Open MCT QuickStart

This repository contains a quick way to get started with Open MCT, integrated with:
* [Open MCT](https://nasa.github.io/openmct/)
* [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/)
* [YAMCS](https://yamcs.org/)
* [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/)

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. cd to the repository directory (usually `openmct-quickstart`)
3. Run `docker compose up`
4. Wait a bit for the containers to start ⏱️
5. Open a browser to http://localhost:8040
6. Enter the username/password
    1. For operators: `operator`/`nasa`
    2. For admin: `admin`/`nasaadmin`

## Nuts and Bolts

The `docker-compose.yml` file in this repository defines a set of containers that work together to provide a complete Open MCT environment. The containers are:
* `openmct` - Builds the Open MCT web application into a shared volume (and quits)
* `couchdb` - The CouchDB database used by Open MCT to persist objects created by the operator.
* `yamcs` - The YAMCS telemetry & commanding server used by Open MCT to retrieve telemetry data.
* `simulator` - A simple python simulator that generates telemetry data for YAMCS to serve.
* `apache` - The Apache HTTP server used to serve the Open MCT web application, and to proxy requests to YAMCS and CouchDB.

Hosted websites are available at the following URLs:
* The OpenMCT web application is served from http://localhost:8040
* The YAMCS web application is served from http://localhost:8040/yamcs
* The Apache server status is served from http://localhost:8040/server-status
* The CouchDB web application is served from http://localhost:8040/couchdb/_utils (with username `admin` and password `password`)
